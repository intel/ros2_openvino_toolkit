## Introduction

The OpenVINO™ (Open visual inference and neural network optimization) toolkit provides a ROS-adaptered runtime framework of neural network which quickly deploys applications and solutions for vision inference. By leveraging Intel® OpenVINO™ toolkit and corresponding libraries, this ROS2 runtime framework extends  workloads across Intel® hardware (including accelerators) and maximizes performance.

See more from [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino) for Intel OpenVINO™ introduction.
