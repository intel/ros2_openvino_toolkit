# ros2_openvino_toolkit

## 1. Introduction
The [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) toolkit quickly deploys applications and solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the Toolkit extends computer vision (CV) workloads across Intel® hardware, maximizing performance.

This project is a ROS2 wrapper for CV API of [OpenVINO™](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit), providing the following features:
* Support CPU and GPU platforms
* Support standard USB camera and Intel® RealSense™ camera
* Support Video or Image file as detection source
* Face detection
* Emotion recognition
* Age and gender recognition
* Head pose recognition
* Object detection
* Demo application to show above detection and recognitions

## 2. Prerequisite
- An x86_64 computer running Ubuntu 16.04. Below processors are supported:
	* 6th-8th Generation Intel® Core™
	* Intel® Xeon® v5 family
	* Intel®  Xeon® v6 family
- ROS2 [Bouncy](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki)
- [OpenVINO™ Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit)
- RGB Camera, e.g. RealSense D400 Series or standard USB camera or Video/Image File
- Graphics are required only if you use a GPU. The official system requirements for GPU are:
	* 6th to 8th generation Intel® Core™ processors with Iris® Pro graphics and Intel® HD Graphics
	* 6th to 8th generation Intel® Xeon® processors with Iris Pro graphics and Intel HD Graphics (excluding the e5 product family, which does not have graphics)
	* Intel® Pentium® processors N4200/5, N3350/5, N3450/5 with Intel HD Graphics

- Use one of the following methods to determine the GPU on your hardware:
	* [lspci] command: GPU info may lie in the [VGA compatible controller] line.
	* Ubuntu system: Menu [System Settings] --> [Details] may help you find the graphics information.
	* Openvino: Download the install package, install_GUI.sh inside will check the GPU information before installation.

	```
## 4. Building and Installation
**Note**:You can choose to build the environment using *./environment_setup.sh* script in the script subfolder.
```bash
./environment_setup_binary.sh hostname password
```
**Note**:You can also choose to follow the steps below to build the environment step by step.
* Build sample code under openvino toolkit
	```bash
	# root is required instead of sudo
	source /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/bin/setupvars.sh
	cd /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples/
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	```
* set ENV CPU_EXTENSION_LIB and GFLAGS_LIB
	```bash
	export CPU_EXTENSION_LIB=/opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples/build/intel64/Release/lib/libcpu_extension.so
	export GFLAGS_LIB=/opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/deployment_tools/inference_engine/samples/build/intel64/Release/lib/libgflags_nothreads.a
	```
* Install ROS2_OpenVINO packages
	```bash
	mkdir -p ~/ros2_overlay_ws/src
	cd ~/ros2_overlay_ws/src
	git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_openvino_toolkit
	git clone https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_msgs
	git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv -b ros2
	```

* Build package
	```
	source ~/ros2_ws/install/local_setup.bash
	source /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/bin/setupvars.sh

## 7. Known Issues
- Parameters "-m_ag, -m_hp, -m_em" should be optional, but samples throw exception without them.
- Parameters "-n_ag, -n_hp, -n_em" doesn't work. The maximum number of face/age/headpose/emotion is always 16.
- Standard USB camera can be unexpected launched with input parameter "-i RealSenseCamera".
